# Windows 11 - All new features

Windows has always been the scene of global innovation. It has always been the backbone of global companies and a place where aggressive startups have become household names. Many of us wrote our first email here, played our first PC game, and wrote our first line of code. Windows is where people create, connect, learn, and achieve - a platform trusted by more than a billion people today.

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in) has now announced its new release [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11). With this release, windows come with tons of new features. Here are some of those features:
