# Best Android VPN browsers for privacy

Use these Android web browsers that come with a free built-in VPN to enhance your privacy and security.

A virtual private network (VPN for short) encrypts your internet activity and hides your location. Since most people use their portable devices (such as smartphones) to go online, they must have a VPN.

This is a list of browsers with built-in VPN on Android, so you don’t need to download additional apps.

Why does your Android smartphone need a VPN?

There are many reasons why you need a VPN. But primarily revolves around privacy and security. This ensures that the data you are transferring is protected. This layer of protection is essential, especially when using public Wi-Fi.

Another thing that makes a VPN service a must-have is that it protects your online activities from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and anyone trying to track your activities through the connected network.

VPN also hides your physical location by providing you with a different virtual IP address, thus hiding your identity. Finally, a VPN allows you to access content or websites that you cannot access at your location. The latter is essential when you still want to access the video streaming service when traveling to an unsupported country.

No need to download additional apps to route your traffic through the secure tunnel, a browser with a built-in VPN can save you some space. There are different VPN services available. Most are free, and some offer subscription options. The free VPN service is good, but it can’t compare with the paid solution.

## 1. [Epic Privacy Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epic.browser&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

The Epic browser also provides a built-in VPN, but you must download it as an extension. VPN has unlimited bandwidth, you can choose one of the available proxy servers located in different countries/regions, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Singapore, Netherlands, and India.

Epic's proxy includes a no-logging strategy, which has always been a key feature of VPN. You can download the extension from the Epic Extensions store by clicking on the mobile extension on the browser homepage.

Although there are a few, they all achieve the same goal of protecting your IP address to protect your privacy. Epic does not limit to, although you will miss the robustness of the VPN service.

Tor is free to use on Android, and there are no restrictions on bandwidth or anything.

## 5. [Opera browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

For many reasons, VPN services are necessary. Maybe you want to bypass geo-restrictions or surf the Internet safely, or anything else you find in the VPN app.
