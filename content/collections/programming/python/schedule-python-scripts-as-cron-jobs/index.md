# Scheduling python program using Cron Jobs

Whether you are a website owner or just someone who needs to schedule
execution of Python scripts, Cron jobs can be very helpful.

## Introduction to Cron Jobs

A cron job is a time-based task that is set to run at specific intervals. Cron jobs are commonly used to schedule system maintenance or administration tasks. For example, you could use a cron job to send out a report every Monday morning. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. Cron enables users to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run automatically at a certain time or date. It is usually used for sysadmin jobs such as backups and system updates. The name cron comes from the Greek word for time, chronos. Cron Jobs in Python Python provides a module named crontab that can be used to manipulate cron jobs from Python programs. The crontab module consists of two classes: CronTab and CronItem .

## What Are Cron Jobs?

Cron jobs are automated tasks that are typically run on a schedule. They are often used to perform maintenance or other repetitive tasks. Cron is a popular tool for scheduling jobs on Unix-like systems. Cron jobs are typically defined in a crontab (cron table) file, which is a text file that contains the commands to be executed and the schedule on which they should be run. The most common use case for cron is to perform routine system maintenance tasks, such as backing up data or deleting temporary files. Cron can also be used to run custom scripts or programs at regular intervals. For example, you could use cron to check for new emails every minute, or generate a daily report of website traffic statistics. Cron is relatively easy to set up and use, making it a popular choice for many system administrators and power users. However, because cron jobs are typically executed without user interaction, it\'s important to carefully consider the security implications of any task that is run by cron. For example, a cron job that deletes files could potentially delete critical system files if it is not configured properly.

## What is a Python Script?

A Python script is a file that contains a set of instructions written in the Python programming language. The file can be executed by running the Python interpreter on your computer with the script\'s filename as an argument. Python scripts are often used to automate repetitive tasks or to interface with other software components. For example, you might use a Python script to fetch data from an API and save it to a database. Or, you might use a Python script to process incoming email messages and forward them to another address. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. Cron enables users to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run automatically at a certain time or
date.

## Why Use Cron Jobs?

Cron jobs are an incredibly useful tool that can help you automate various tasks on your computer. For instance, you could use a cron job to automatically backup your files every night, or to email you when someone mentions your name on social media. There are a few reasons why you might want to use cron jobs:

1. Automate repetitive tasks: If you have a task that needs to be done regularly, a cron job can automate it for you. This means that you don\'t have to remember to do the task yourself, and it will get done even if you\'re not around. 
 
2.  Save time: By automating tasks, cron jobs can save you a lot of time. This is especially useful if you have multiple tasks that need to be done regularly. 


3.  Avoid errors: Human beings are prone to making mistakes, but computers aren\'t. If you automate a task with a cron job, you can be sure that it will be done correctly every time. 
 
4. Get things done while you\'re away: If you need to get something done while you\'re away from your computer, a cron job can do it for you. For example, if you\'re going on vacation and want to make sure your website is backed up, you can set up a cron job to do it for you while you\'re gone. 


5. Run multiple tasks simultaneously: Cron jobs can run multiple tasks at

## Creating cron jobs for python using crontab

Python cron jobs are an easy way to schedule Python scripts to run automatically. They can be used to schedule tasks such as backing up files, sending emails, or updating data. To set up a Python cron job, you will first need to create a Python script that you want to run. This script can be as simple or complex as you like. Once you have created your script, you will need to save it in a location that is accessible to the cron job system. Next, you will need to create a file called \"crontab\" in the same directory as your Python script. This file will contain the instructions for your cron job. Each line in the file represents a different task that you want the cron job to perform. The first line of the file should look like this: 

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash
```


 This tells the system which shell to use when running the commands in the cron job file. The next line is where you will specify the schedule for your cron job. This schedule is made up of six fields: minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week, and command. The asterisk character ( \* ) is used as a wildcard in these fields. For example, if you wanted your cron job to run every minute, you would use this schedule: 

 ```bash
 \* \* \* \* \* /path/to/your/script.py 
 ```
 
 If you wanted your cron job to run every hour, you would use this schedule: 

 ```bash
 0 \* \* \* \* /path/to/your/script.py 
 ```
 You can also use multiple asterisks in a single field. For example, if you wanted your cron job to run every day at midnight, you would use this schedule:

```bash 
  0 0 \* \* \* /path/to/your/script.py
```
 The final field on each line is the command that you want the cron job to run. In our example, this is the path to our Python script. Once you have created your crontab file, you will need to add it to the cron job system. This can be done with the following command: 

 ```bash
 $ crontab /path/to/your/crontabfile 
 ```
 
 This will add your cron jobs to the system and they will be executed according to the schedule that you have specified. You can view the cron jobs that are currently in the system with the following command: \$ crontab -l And you can remove a cron job from the system with the following command: \$ crontab -r

Cron jobs are automated tasks that are typically run on a schedule. They are often used to perform maintenance or other repetitive tasks. Cron is a popular tool for scheduling jobs on Unix-like systems. Cron jobs are typically defined in a crontab (cron table) file, which is a text file that contains the commands to be executed and the schedule on which they should be run.
