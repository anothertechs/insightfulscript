# Belt Hold Line Candlestick Pattern

Belt Hold is candlestick pattern is considered as a modest reversal pattern that can suggest a bearish or bullish trend reversal depending on the pattern and direction of the trend it appears. Belt Hold Candlestick pattern is called yorikiri in Japanese..

The model is one single pattern, nearly the same as Marubozu's, because the pattern showed the force of bearish and bullish activity. It has a large, real body with small or no shadows. The single bar in an upward trend is a possible top-turn pattern and the pattern is a bare ribbon holding pattern.

Bearish Belt  hold consists of a black candle, opening at or near the top and closing on or around the bottom, leaving very little bottom or top shadows. A bullish hold pattern, on the other hand, appears downstream and is a possible reverse pattern of the bottom. The candle opens at or close to the high and ends at or near the low. It consists of a rising candle.

The height of these bars indicates a potential change in sentiment; thus, the pattern becomes increasingly crucial as the candles grow in size.


Both the bullish and bearish belt hold patterns are more dependable when they appear at the market's extremes, as indicated by support, trend lines and moving averages,pivot points , and resistance levels. 
They become much more important when combined with other patterns, such as the [engulfing pattern](https://anothertechs.com/crypto/the-engulfing-pattern/) or the [dark cloud cover](https://anothertechs.com/crypto/dark-cloud-cover/)  pattern.


The belt hold is a particular candlestick pattern that provides one of the most specific clues of the current market's direction. 
However, simply understanding how to spot this pattern is insufficient.

When a bullish belt hold candlestick appears, it implies that purchasers controlled the share price for the whole trading session because the share price never fell below its initial share price.


The share price has only risen since the trading session began, which is why a bullish belt hold has no lower shadow. 
The buyers have been in command throughout the trading session.


The bearish belt hold suggests a short-term shift in attitude from bullish to bearish. 
The top of the bearish belt hold is converted into a resistance line. 
If the belt holds resistance line aligns with an already formed one, it receives more weight.

### Entery 

After spotting the belt, hold a candlestick, open a position in the direction of the candle and go long immediately after it closes.

### Stop Loss

Always use a stop-loss order to safeguard your belt hold transactions, just like you would any other trade. 
The stop-loss should be placed precisely beneath the entry candle's low. 
However, because the marubozu candle appears during periods of extreme volatility, the price action will frequently reach the stop if it is positioned correctly on the other side of the candle.

As a result, it is recommended that you set your stop-loss one candle away from the marabozu. 
If you are buying a stock on the low belt signal, set your stop-loss below the candle's low that follows the closing marubozu candle. 
If you are selling on a belt hold signal, your stop-loss order should be placed above the candle that precedes the marubozu.

### Profit

Set an initial aim when using a belt hold line trade. 
The first option is to exit your position when the stock reaches a size that is at least twice or three times the size of the marubozu pattern.

The other way for profit taking is to employ price action rules to determine when to exit your trades; this, of course, requires more skill and, most importantly, discipline.
