# Understanding the Shooting Star Candlestick Pattern

When the term "Shooting Star" is mentioned, many envision a celestial object descending towards the earth's surface. In the realm of Technical Analysis, however, a shooting star takes on a different meaningâ€”it represents a bearish candlestick pattern characterized by a long upper shadow and the absence of a lower shadow.

## What Exactly is the Shooting Star Candlestick Pattern?

The shooting star candlestick pattern is identified by a bearish candlestick with a significant upper shadow, minimal or no lower shadow, and a small real body near the period's low. This pattern typically emerges after a period of upward movement in prices. Specifically, it occurs when a security opens, experiences substantial upward momentum, but ultimately closes near its opening price.

To be classified as a shooting star, this pattern must manifest during a price advance, and the distance between the highest price of the period and the opening price should be more than twice the size of the shooting star's body. Additionally, there should be little to no shadow below the real body of the candlestick.

## Key Psychological Insights into the Shooting Star Candlestick Pattern

The shooting star pattern signifies a potential price top and an impending reversal. It is particularly effective when it appears after a series of 2-3 consecutive rising candles with higher highs, indicating a strong upward trend. This pattern reflects the battle between buyers and sellers during the trading session.

At the start of the period, buyers push the price significantly higher, demonstrating continued buying pressure. However, as the period progresses, sellers step in and drive the price back down towards the open, erasing the gains made earlier in the day. This shift indicates that buyers have lost control by the session's close, and sellers are gaining dominance.

The extended upper shadow of the shooting star represents buyers who initially entered the market during the period but are now facing losses as the price retraces back to the opening level. Confirmation of the shooting star pattern comes from the subsequent candlestick, which should open lower or near the previous close and then move lower with increased volume. This confirmation suggests a high probability of a price reversal and potential further decline.
