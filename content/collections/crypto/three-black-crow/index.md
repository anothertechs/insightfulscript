# Three Black Crows Candlestick Pattern

The term "three black crows" refers to a bearish candlestick pattern that may indicate an uptrend's reversal. Candlestick charts depict a security's opening, high, low, and closing prices for the day. The candlestick for stocks moving higher is white or green. They become dark or red as they descend.

Three consecutive long-bodied candlesticks that opened within the real body of the preceding candle and closed lower than the previous candle make up the black crow pattern. Traders frequently combine this signal with other technical indicators or chart patterns to confirm a reversal.

As previously said, the three black crows pattern signals the start of a negative trend in the market. You should pay attention to the length of the candlesticks once you've identified what appears to be a three black crows pattern.

To confirm that the bears have complete dominance, the second and third candles should be roughly similar in size. **If the third candle is noticeably smaller than the rest, the pattern is weak and useless.**

Once an uptrend has run its course, the pattern begins to emerge. This signifies the start of a significant downturn, and you should take a short position.

On a mini pullback, you should enter after the pattern has developed. The Three Black Crows pattern appears in the chart above, followed by two candles of consolidation before going lower.

Stops should be placed above the pattern's start, with the goal of catching a break beneath the chart pattern. A pullback to a moving average or another level of support could be the case.
