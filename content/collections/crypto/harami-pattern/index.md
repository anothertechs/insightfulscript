The stock market is constantly a battleground between bulls (buying) and bears (sellers).
It's all about supply and demand.

_Consider the following scenario:_

For the past few days, a stock has been declining.
A large red candle appears one day, indicating that the sellers have complete control.

The stock opens the gap higher the next day.
Those who are short on the stock begin to fear that it will rise in price as a result of the price increase.

They cover their short bets, causing the price to rise even more.

The grip of the sellers is diminishing as the price rises. The purchasers are gaining the upper hand.
